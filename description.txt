[The Cookie Mod (Food and Much More!) v0.5.0]

Welcome to the Cookie Mod! This is a mod heavely influenced by the youtuber Happy Days (though non-Happy fans can find something to love aswell) developed currently by three people:
Danew Dr
Cookie Biscuit
Warren Mark

This mod is still work-in-progress so some things may not be completely balnced (*cough* values *cough*) and many sprites still need changing. We would love some more active spriters and/or coders to speed up development and overall make the mod better!
Enough of me blabering away here's what the mod has instore,
Now with:
Enough content to take you all the way to hardmode
+ 230 total items inculding:
	61 basic items (Including tools, accesories and buff "drinks")
	38 pieces of armor
	26 placeable items
	104 weapons
+ A new class: the cook class (currently only has enough content until hardmode)
+ 1 new biome (that's kinda barren at the moment)
+ 3 bosses (with boss checklist support)
+ 1 new town NPC (spawns in after EoC is defeated, sells more items after defeating pre-hardmode bosses)
+ 9 new enemies (2 excluding boss spawned enemies)
Changes to 3 vanilla items (bottled water, honey & bowl of soup)
