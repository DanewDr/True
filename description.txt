[The Cookie Mod (Food and Much More!) v0.5.1]

*IMPORTANT ANOUNCEMENT*
After much discussion amongst the dev team, we have decided that the mod is in need of a complete overhaul and, put simply, restart. We have many reasons for this which will be discussed further both on the discord and forum page. Also on the discord you can find the complete changelog for this update
The forum page and discord will keep a copy of this version of the mod once the first version of the restart is released
The rest of the description will remain slightly outdated, especially regarding specific numbers
Thankyou for all your support over the years, and we can't wait so see where the mod goes into the future!

Welcome to the Cookie Mod! This is a mod heavely influenced by the youtuber Happy Days (though non-Happy fans can find something to love aswell) developed currently by three people:
Danew Dr
Cookie Biscuit
Warren Mark

This mod is still work-in-progress so some things may not be completely balnced (*cough* values *cough*) and many sprites still need changing. We would love some more active spriters and/or coders to speed up development and overall make the mod better!
Enough of me blabering away here's what the mod has instore,
Now with:
Enough content to take you all the way to hardmode
+ 230 total items inculding:
	61 basic items (Including tools, accesories and buff "drinks")
	38 pieces of armor
	26 placeable items
	104 weapons
+ A new class: the cook class (currently only has enough content until hardmode)
+ 1 new biome (that's kinda barren at the moment)
+ 3 bosses (with boss checklist support)
+ 1 new town NPC (spawns in after EoC is defeated, sells more items after defeating pre-hardmode bosses)
+ 9 new enemies (2 excluding boss spawned enemies)
Changes to 3 vanilla items (bottled water, honey & bowl of soup)
